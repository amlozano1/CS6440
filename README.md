# EHR (Electronic Health Record) Project Summary

As we know from the course reading, current EHR's are typically deficient in the things that they collect and display. Moreover, the visualization challenge, particularly within healthcare as a whole, is largely unsolved. 

Thus, in order to to make a significant contribution, our team will be attempt to develop a web application that features a novel solution to the visualization problem within electronic health records. This will be delivered by the end of the course!
